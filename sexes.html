<h1>Alternative sex tagging system for erotic and pornographic artwork</h1>	
<h2>Dear friends of porn and social justice</h2>
<section>There have been many discussions about how to avoid potentially misgendering and/or problematic terms like "Futa", "Shemale", "Dickgirl", "Hermaphrodite", "Cuntboy" and even "male" or "female" while trying to describe the specific set of genitals a character has. Here I want to propose an alternative. 
</section>	
<h2>The basics</h2>
<section> Each component of the possible genitals gets an own abbreviations.</section>	
<table><tableheader>The abbreviations chosen for this example</tableheader><tablebody>
	<tr>
	<td>Component</td>
	<td>Abbreviations</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Penis</td>
	<td>pe</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Testes</td>
	<td>te</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Breasts </td>
	<td>ma</td>
	</tr>		<tr>
	<td>Vagina</td>
	<td>va</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Clitoris</td>
	<td>cli</td>
	</tr>
</tablebody></table>
<section>A composed abbreviation of these elements is than used to describe a set of genitals. 
	Components that are not included in a character get a prefix, for example a simple "no" or maybe a "!" or a "~". 
	A prefix for included components may be useful in case a parser is used.
	The system would allow to avoid commonly used character tropes and also propose a certain degree of additional freedom.
	Wheter the system is to be used only for visible components or also for internal ones, like testes for reptilian characters is up to diskussion. 
	Generally I would disrecommend.
</section>	
<table><tableheader>The search-abbreviations </tableheader><tablebody>
	<tr>
	<td>Term</td>
	<td><em>Possible</em> Definition</td>
	<td>Composed Abbreviation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Male (typically)</td>
	<td>Someone who has a penis, no external testes, no breasts, no vagina, no clitoris</td>
	<td>petenomanovanocli</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Male (more general)</td>
	<td>Someone who has a penis, external testes, no breasts, no vagina, no clitoris</td>
	<td>petenomanovanocli</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Male (castrated/internal balls)</td>
	<td>Someone who has a penis, no external testes, no breasts, no vagina, no clitoris</td>
	<td>penotenomanovanocli</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Female (Human)</td>
	<td>Someone who has a vagina, breasts, a clitoris, no penis, no testes</td>
	<td>nopenotemavacli</td>
	</tr>
	<td>Female (more general, )</td>
	<td>Someone who has a vagina, no penis, no testes </td>
	<td>nopenoteva</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Futa</td>
	<td>Someone with breasts and vagina, that has a penis in place of a clit.</td>
	<td>pemava</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>"Full Herm"</td>
	<td>Someone with a penis, testes, a vagina and breasts </td>
	<td>petemava(cli)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Shemale</td>
	<td>Someone with a penis, testes, breasts, no vagina and no clit </td>
	<td>petemanovanocli</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Cuntboy</td>
	<td>Someone with a vagina, no penis, no balls and no breasts</td>
	<td>nopenotenova(cli)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Nullo</td>
	<td>Someone without any genitals</td>
	<td>nopenotenomanova(nocli)</td>
	</tr>
</tablebody></table>

<section>It would also be possible to search for things you couldn't express in a single tag earlier. </section>	



<h2>Possible implementation</h2>
<section>I would suggest an implementation via an implication table. Implication table work pretty much like this:
	The user searches for a term, for example "vaginal". 
	The database looks up the implikation table and puts out all submissions tagged with "vaginal" but also every submission tagged with a tag that implies "vaginal", like for example submission tagged with "vaginal_penetration" or "vaginal_creampie". 
	The table down below shows the first 500 implication Table Entrys generated by my little script, based on my proposed abbrevations. Atm. the script is set up in a way, that any order of component abbrevations is accepted. 
	If this would be problematic for a websites performance (since a couple of thousend entrys are generated) it could be reduced by using a given order and deleting all were unlikely entrys, for example entrys that enclude "novacli" and "nopete", 
	Since it is very unlikely, that a character has a clitoris but no vagina, or testes but not a penis.
	
</section>
<h2>Possible extensions</h2>
<section>you could also add additional information, like which role the character takes (sub/dom/bottom/top/switch) or what the characters gender expression is (feminine, androgyn, masculin, neutral). However, these may seem very subjective.
